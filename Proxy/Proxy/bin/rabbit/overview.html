Rabbit is a proxy, but it does also provide classes that may be
useful in other projects if you want non blocking http client
or server code.

<p>
If you want to build non blocking <b>clients</b> you probably want to 
start by checking out the {@link rabbit.client.sample} classes.

<p>
If you want to build a non blocking <b>server</b> you probably want to 
check out the {@link rabbit.webserver} classes.

<p>
Please note that the rabbit.nio package has been split off into it's own
project, <b><a href="http://www.khelekore.org/rnio/">rnio</a></b>.
